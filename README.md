# VHDL Digital Design Repository

This repository contains my VHDL practice and project work, organized into basic building blocks and complete systems.

## Structure
- `/basics/` — Foundational logic circuits (MUX, decoders, adders, flip-flops)
- `/projects/` — Complex, real-world designs built using the basic modules

## Tools Used
- Quartus Prime
- ModelSim
- Vivado

## Topics Covered
- Combinational Logic
- Sequential Circuits
- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Parameterized Designs
- Testbench Simulation

## Author
